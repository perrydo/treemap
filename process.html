                        <p class="lead">A simple, lightweight, interactive open-source base map</p>
                        <p class="mb-2">As building the project based on free, open-source technology is one of the major requirements, leaflet map – a leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps – was chosen. Leaflet utilizes map data from OpenStreetMap as well as map tiles from Mapbox and has very simple, easy-to-use API.</p>
                        <p class="mb-2">Many factors were taken into consideration for the design of the map. Most web maps tend to have a set zoom and starting location. However, as this project aims to have users across Ontario input significant native tree data on-the-go, the map is set to automatically centered to the user’s current location – if they allow permission to access their location. Furthermore, dark theme is applied to help save energy when travelling and help the tree markers stand out more.</p>

                        <h2>Making A Submission Form</h2>
                        <p class="lead">A simple survey form to collect significant tree data</p>
                        <p class="mb-2">Now that the base map has been set up, it is time to start collecting significant native tree data. Because this project relies on public input, having a free, simple submission process is uttermost important. We decided to use KoBo Toolbox, which is a free open-source tool for mobile data collection used to collect data in the field using mobile devices such as mobile phones or tablets. Particularly, we used a product called Humanitarian Response – which can be used offline and very easy to use, suitable for people who want to submit tree data in the field where cell phone signals may not present.</p>
                        <p class="mb-2">The submission form collects the location of the user/tree automatically. Users can also change the location; however, it is advised that they should submit data right in the field. A list of most common native tree species in Ontario is provided for users to choose quickly, including the options for trees that are not on the list. Users will have to submit a photo of the significant tree for identification – that way other users can also visit the tree and recognize it. They are also encouraged to leave a comment explaining why the tree they submitted is significant.</p>
